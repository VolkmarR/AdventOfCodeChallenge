# Advent of Code Challenge 2025

## Rules

* To win the challenge, you have to collect stars by solving programming puzzles in your spare time
* Every silver star counts 1 point, every gold star counts 2 points
* The points will be summed up on ~31.12.2025 at 12:00~ **15.12.2025 at 9:00**
* Keep all your source code used to solve the puzzles in order to be eligible to win (I recommend a private GitHub repo that you can make public at the end of the challenge)

## How to participate

* First, you have to register on the site [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/2025/auth/login). I recommend using your GitHub user. 
* Then you can join the [private leaderboard](https://adventofcode.com/2025/leaderboard/private) with the code 377318-b2f5c085

## Prizes

* This year I will offer two different prizes
* Only employees of ACS Group (ACS, Consisto, Cyberlys, Infinitys, Infominds, Printyway, ...) are eligible to win (me excluded)
* The winners must provide the source code as a public GitHub repo
* If multiple participants collected the same number of stars, the winner will be selected ~using the Advent of Code Leaderboard, ordered by stars~ by drawing lots.

### Champion prize 

* The participant with the most points on ~31.12.2025 at 12:00~ **15.12.2025 at 9:00** will win
* If one of the participants collects all ~50~ 24 stars before the end of the challenge, he/she will win automatically 

### Best newcomer prize
