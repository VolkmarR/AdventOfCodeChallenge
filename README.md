* To win the challenge, you have to collect stars by solving programming puzzles in your spare time
* Every silver star counts 1 point, every gold star counts 2 points
* The points will be summed up on the 31.12.2024 at 12:00
* Keep all your source code used to solve the puzzles in order to be eligible to win (I recommend a private GitHub repo, that you can make public at the end of the challenge)
